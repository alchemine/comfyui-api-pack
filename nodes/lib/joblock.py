"""Shared single-file job lock for fire-and-forget remote jobs.

One `jobs.lock` file in the pack directory tracks at most one in-flight job per
*kind* (e.g. `"api"`, `"grok"`). Each kind is an independent slot: an API job and
a Grok job can be in flight at the same time, but only one of each. The file
persists across restarts, so a mid-flight job is remembered even if ComfyUI is
restarted. A process-level lock guards the read-modify-write so concurrent
submits can't both pass the "is this kind free?" check at the same instant.

File shape::

    {"api": {<record>}, "grok": {<record>}}

A missing key, or a record without a truthy `prompt_id`/`request_id`, means that
kind's slot is free.
